# Reverse Insertion Sort

Consider the code for insertion sort we covered in class:

```javascript
function insertionSort(arr) {
  for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    var val = arr[i];
    var j;
    for(j = i; j > 0 && arr[j-1] > val; j--) {
      arr[j] = arr[j-1];
    }
    arr[j] = val;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

Change this function such that it works from the end of the array rather than
the beginning, `insertionSortReverse()` -- only the direction of
iterating over the elements is reversed, the array is still sorted the same way
(ascending). Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Average-Case Time Complexity of Insertion Sort

In the lectures, we covered that insertion sort has best-case time complexity of
$\Theta(n)$ and worst-case time complexity of $\Theta(n^2)$. What is the
average-case time complexity ($\Theta$)?

Hint: Think about what happens in each iteration of the loop, and how often the
loop is executed. Keep in mind that for asymptotic analysis we don't care about
constant factors.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is
most important -- you can easily find the answer, but you need to demonstrate
that you've understood the concept. Add your answer to this markdown file.

**Answer:**

We know that the best case complexity for insertion sort occurs when the data set is already completely sorted. When we evaluate the average case, we know that the set will not be completely sorted.

Partially sorted? Maybe. But we cannot make any generalizations based off an arbitrarily partially sorted set. Thus, for the average case, we cannot justify any claim that the time complexity is any better asymptotically than the worst case complexity, which is $\Theta(n^2)$. Even if, for each element, we only have to move it an average of n/10 spaces to get that element sorted, this really has no asymptotical difference. So the average case time complexity of insertion sort is $\Theta(n^2)$.
